# Railway booking system
## Short description
Passenger creates a request for a ticket to some station. In the request, he specifies desired departure station, desired destination, desired time and date of departure. The system performs searching routes, that match user request. Passenger chooses route from that list and receives a bill for paying. Administrator changes status of passengers bills to 'paid' or 'rejected'.
